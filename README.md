## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone repository and install the dependencies:


Preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000`.
